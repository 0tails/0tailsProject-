Local AI environment project for research and personal learning.
# AI Room Project  
This project is part of my journey to build a private, local AI environment  
using open-source tools and LLMs. The goal is to create a persistent AI companion  
with memory and personality, running entirely on local hardware.  

Technologies planned:  
- Python  
- FastAPI  
- Ollama (LLaMA/Mistral models)  
- SQLite & ChromaDB for memory storage
